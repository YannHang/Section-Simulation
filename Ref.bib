For an initial coherent state polarized along an eigenvector, we prove that the nonlinear evolution preserves the separation of modes, in a scaling such that nonlinear effects are critical (the envelope equation is nonlinear). The proof relies on a fine geometric analysis of the role of spectral projectors, which is compatible with the treatment of nonlinearities. We also prove a nonlinear superposition principle for these adiabatic wave packets.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantum adiabatic evolution is a dynamical evolution of a quantum system under slow external driving. According to the quantum adiabatic theorem, no transitions occur between nondegenerate instantaneous energy eigenstates in such a dynamical evolution. However, this is true only when the driving rate is infinitesimally small. For a small nonzero driving rate, there are generally small transition probabilities between the energy eigenstates. We develop a classical mechanics framework to address the small deviations from the quantum adiabatic theorem order by order. A hierarchy of Hamiltonians is constructed iteratively with the zeroth-order Hamiltonian being determined by the original system Hamiltonian. The k th-order deviations are governed by a k th-order Hamiltonian, which depends on the time derivatives of the adiabatic parameters up to the k th-order. Two simple examples, the Landau–Zener model and a spin-1/2 particle in a rotating magnetic field, are used to illustrate our hierarchical theory. Our analysis also exposes a deep, previously unknown connection between classical adiabatic theory and quantum adiabatic theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Superflow of a Bose–Einstein condensate in an optical lattice is represented by a Bloch wave, a plane wave with periodic modulation of the amplitude. We review the theoretical results of the interaction effects in the energy dispersion of the Bloch waves and in the linear stability of such waves. For sufficiently strong repulsion between the atoms, the lowest Bloch band develops a loop at the edge of the Brillouin zone, with the dramatic consequence of a finite probability of Landau–Zener tunnelling even in the limit of a vanishing external force. Superfluidity can exist in the central region of the Brillouin zone in the presence of a repulsive interaction, beyond which Landau instability takes place where the system can lower its energy by making a transition into states with smaller Bloch wavenumbers. In the outer part of the region of Landau instability, the Bloch waves are also dynamically unstable in the sense that a small initial deviation grows exponentially in time. In the inner region of Landau instability, a Bloch wave is dynamically stable in the absence of persistent external perturbations. Experimental implications of our findings will be discussed.},

We show that, for a general state beyond eigenstate, the intrinsic dynamical fluctuations neglected by the conventional adiabatic theorem will inevitably give rise to phase factors which greatly depend on the details of the adiabatic process (adiabatic parameter evolution). Thus, contrary to the general belief that the total phase is only composed of the dynamical phase and geometric phase, intriguing intrinsic ‘pollution’ terms are discovered. An experimental scheme for detecting the ‘pollution’ terms based on optical waveguides is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = { Experimental data show that the speed of colloidal (catalytic) motors decreases as the size of the motor particles increases. However, previous electrokinetic models have shown that the colloidal motor speed for spheres is independent of size, at least for the case of infinitesimally thin double layers and reaction-limited catalysis. Although a size dependence of motor speed has been calculated for diffusion-limited catalysis, most motor experiments are done in the reaction-limited regime. This apparent contradiction led us to examine how motor speed (U) changes with distance (δ) from a wall, starting from the usual electrokinetic equations. A key finding is that interactions between a colloidal motor and a nearby wall produce a localized electroosmotic (LEO) flow field that can significantly alter the motor speed near the wall. Because large motor particles typically settle closer to the wall than small motors, LEO thus provides at least one explanation of the size dependence of motor speed. Furthermore, LEO provides a new method of creating flow fields in capillaries and microchannels. },

We quantify for arbitrary swimmer shapes and surface patterns, how efficient swimming requires both surface 'activity' to generate the fields, and surface 'phoretic mobility.' We show in particular that (i) swimming requires symmetry breaking in either or both of the patterns of 'activity' and 'mobility,' and (ii) for a given geometrical shape and surface pattern, the swimming velocity is size-independent. In addition, for given available surface properties, our calculation framework provides a guide for optimizing the design of swimmers.},

The model also enables the measurement of reaction kinetic parameters that are otherwise difficult to obtain. This quantitative model serves as a platform for the modeling of other catalytic redox systems and systems with broken symmetries.},

Then the solution is extended to include the higher-order terms which are required to describe the motion of a solid sphere. Singularities of higher orders at the centre of the sphere are obtained by using the method of reflexions. For a fluid–fluid interface with an arbitrary viscosity ratio, the drag force and the hydrodynamic torque are calculated for the special cases of motion of a sphere perpendicular and parallel to the interface. In addition, the rotational motion of a sphere is also investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {Mitchell originally proposed that an asymmetric ion flux across an organism's membrane could generate electric fields that drive locomotion. Although this locomotion mechanism was later rejected for some species of bacteria, engineered Janus particles have been realized that can swim due to ion fluxes generated by asymmetric electrochemical reactions. Here we present governing equations, scaling analyses and numerical simulations that describe the motion of bimetallic rod-shaped motors in hydrogen peroxide solutions due to reaction-induced charge auto-electrophoresis. The coupled Poisson–Nernst–Planck–Stokes equations are numerically solved using Frumkin-corrected Butler–Volmer equations to represent electrochemical reactions at the rod surface. Our simulations show strong agreement with the scaling analysis and experiments. The analysis shows that electrokinetic locomotion results from electro-osmotic fluid slip around the nanomotor surface. The electroviscous flow is driven by electrical body forces which are generated from a coupling of a reaction-induced dipolar charge density distribution and the electric field it creates. The magnitude of the electroviscous velocity increases quadratically with the surface reaction rate for an uncharged motor, and linearly when the motor supports a finite surface charge.},

  Abstract                 = {Within a unified formulation-encompassing self-electrophoresis, self-diffusiophoresis, and self-thermophoresis-we provide a simple integral kernel transforming the relevant surface flux to particle velocity for any spheroid with axisymmetric surface activity and uniform phoretic mobility. Appropriate scaling of the speed allows a dimensionless measure of the motion-producing performance of the motor shape and activity distribution across the surface. For bipartite designs with piecewise uniform flux over complementary surface regions, the performance is mapped out over the entire range of geometry (from discotic through spherical to rodlike shapes) and of bipartitioning, and intermediate aspect ratios that maximize performance are identified. Comparisons are made to experimental data from the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {The equations which govern the ion distributions and velocities{,} the electrostatic potential and the hydrodynamic flow field around a solid colloidal particle in an applied electric field are reexamined. By using the linearity of the equations which determine the electrophoretic mobility{,} we show that for a colloidal particle of shape the mobility is independent of the dielectric properties of the particle and the electrostatic boundary conditions on the particle surface. The mobility depends only on the particle size and shape{,} the properties of the electrolyte solution in which it is suspended{,} and the charge inside{,} or electrostatic potential on{,} the hydrodynamic shear plane in the of an applied field or any macroscopic motion.New expressions for the forces acting in the particle are derived and a novel substitution is developed which leads to a significant decoupling of the governing equations. These analytic developments allow for the construction of a rapid{,} robust numerical scheme for the solution of the governing equations which we have applied to the case of a spherical colloidal particle in a general electrolyte solution. We describe a computer program for the conversion of mobility measurements to zeta potential for a spherical colloidal particle which is far more flexible than the Wiersema graphs which have traditionally been used for the interpretation of mobility data. Furthermore it is free of the high zeta potential convergence difficulties which limited Wiersema{'}s calculations to moderate values of . Some sample computations in typical 1:1 and 2:1 electrolytes are exhibited which illustrate the existence of a in the mobility at high zeta potentials. The physical explanation of this effect is given. The importance of the mobility maximum in testing the validity of the governing equations of electrophoresis and its implications for the colloid chemist{'}s picture of the Stern layer are briefly discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Achieving control over the directionality of active colloids is essential for their use in practical applications such as cargo carriers in microfluidic devices. So far, guidance of spherical Janus colloids was mainly realized using specially engineered magnetic multilayer coatings combined with external magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate that step-like submicrometre topographical features can be used as reliable docking and guiding platforms for chemically active spherical Janus colloids. For various topographic features (stripes, squares or circular posts), docking of the colloid at the feature edge is robust and reliable. Furthermore, the colloids move along the edges for significantly long times, which systematically increase with fuel concentration. The observed phenomenology is qualitatively captured by a simple continuum model of self-diffusiophoresis near confining boundaries, indicating that the chemical activity and associated hydrodynamic interactions with the nearby topography are the main physical ingredients behind the observed behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {We revisit the time-adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics and show that it can be extended to weakly nonlinear situations, that is to nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equations in which either the nonlinear coupling constant or, equivalently, the solution is asymptotically small. To this end, a notion of criticality is introduced at which the linear bound states stay adiabatically stable, but nonlinear effects start to show up at leading order in the form of a slowly varying nonlinear phase modulation. In addition, we prove that in the same regime a class of nonlinear bound states also stays adiabatically stable, at least in terms of spectral projections.},

  Abstract                 = {Micron-sized particles moving through a solution in response to self-generated chemical gradients serve as model systems for studying active matter. Their far-reaching potential applications will require the particles to sense and respond to their local environment in a robust manner. The self-generated hydrodynamic and chemical fields{,} which induce particle motion{,} probe and are modified by that very environment{,} including confining boundaries. Focusing on a catalytically active Janus particle as a paradigmatic example{,} we predict that near a hard planar wall such a particle exhibits several scenarios of motion: reflection from the wall{,} motion at a steady-state orientation and height above the wall{,} or motionless{,} steady {"}hovering.{"} Concerning the steady states{,} the height and the orientation are determined both by the proportion of catalyst coverage and the interactions of the solutes with the different {"}faces{"} of the particle. Accordingly{,} we propose that a desired behavior can be selected by tuning these parameters via a judicious design of the particle surface chemistry.},

The results of finite element modeling agree well with experimental measurements of the efficiency of catalytic Pt-Au nanorod motors. Modifications of the composition and shape of bimetallic catalytic motors were predicted computationally and found experimentally to lead to higher efficiency. The efficiencies of bubble-propelled catalytic micromotors, magnetically driven flagellar motors, Janus micromotors driven by self-generated thermal gradients, and ultrasonically driven metallic micromotors are also analyzed and discussed.},

Despite the nonzero ion flux, Boltzmann's equation continues to describe the relationship between either ion concentration and the electrostatic potential inside the diffuse part of the double layer, while local electroneutrality applies outside, even for current densities approaching the limiting value. In the absence of ion adsorption or dissociation reactions at the electrodes, the magnitude of any charge or zeta potential arising on the electrodes at zero current is determined by the equilibrium constant for the redox reactions which would exchange ionic charge carriers for electric charge carriers at the electrode surface. Nonzero current causes the ionic strength of the bulk to vary with position. This perturbs the Debye length of the diffuse cloud on either electrode: it is the local ionic strength just outside the cloud which determines the Debye length for that cloud. Nonzero current also changes the zeta potential. The dimensionless rate of change dζ/dJ was as large as 30. },
